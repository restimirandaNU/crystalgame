Crystal Game
Week 4 for NU Coding Bootcamp - using JQuery!

Description
The random number shown at the start of the game between 19 - 120. Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12.

How the crystal game works:

   * There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

   * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

   * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

     * Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
     * When they do click one, update the player's score counter.

   * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

   * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
